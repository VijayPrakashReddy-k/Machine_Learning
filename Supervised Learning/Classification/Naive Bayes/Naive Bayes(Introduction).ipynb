    "- It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also perform well in multi class prediction\n",
    "- When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.\n",

    "​\n",
    "- If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\n",
    "- On the other side naive Bayes is also known as a **bad estimator**, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously.\n",
