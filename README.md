"Data is the new oil" is a saying which you must have heard by now along with the huge interest building up around Big Data and Machine Learning in the recent past along with Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Besides this, data scientists have been termed as having "The sexiest job in the 21st Century" which makes it all the more worthwhile to build up some valuable expertise in these areas. Getting started with machine learning in the real world can be overwhelming with the vast amount of resources out there on the web. It's About ML Algorithms and Datasets

Machine learning algorithms have 3 broad categories -
1.Supervised learning — the input features and the output labels are defined.
2.Unsupervised learning — the dataset is unlabeled and the goal is to discover hidden relationships.
3.Reinforcement learning — some form of feedback loop is present and there is a need to optimize some parameter.
## 1.Supervised learning
### a) Regression

With linear regression, the objective is to fit a line through the distribution which is nearest to most of the points in the training set.
In simple linear regression, the regression line minimizes the sum of distances from the individual points, that is, the sum of the “Square of Residuals”. Hence, this method is also called the “Ordinary Least Square”.
Linear regression can also be achieved in case of multidimensional data i.e. data-sets that have multiple features. In this case, the ‘line’ is just a higher dimensional plane with dimensions ‘N-1’, N being the dimension of the dataset.
